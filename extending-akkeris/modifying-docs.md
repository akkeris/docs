# Modifying the docs

Contributing to documentation is a great way of helping out your own source community! You can open up a new PR [on Github](https://github.com/akkeris/docs). To contribute to the docs you'll first need a [Github](https://github.com) account, and be familiar with `git` and the Terminal.

1. Go to https://github.com/akkeris/docs 
2. Ensure you are logged in to Github, if not, login.
3. Click on the "Fork" icon at the top right
4. Clone your forked version using `git clone https://github.com/[your-user-name]/docs`
5. Open a new branch `git checkout -b 'name-of-branch'`
6. Make any modifications to the documentation. We use gitbook and markdown to write in.
7. Commit and push your changes `git commit -a -m 'Your commit message' ; git push`
8. Then go back to your forked Github repository and at the top there will be a message to submit a pull request.
