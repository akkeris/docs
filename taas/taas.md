# TaaS

Akkeris Testing as a Service (TaaS) gives developers a place to host and run automated testing frameworks. TaaS is a big step towards making Akkeris a fully featured CI/CD offering - with TaaS, you can commit code, run automated tests, and promote your app along a development pipeline in a single step. You can run almost any test framework of your choice, as long as it can run as a Docker image and exits with a zero (pass) or nonzero (fail).
